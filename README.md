## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SMSAT-dataset.git
cd SMSAT-dataset/code
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Dataset
The dataset is hosted on Kaggle: ðŸ‘‰ SMSAT Dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crdkhan/qmsat-dataset/data
---

## âš¡ Usage

Train the SMSAT Encoder:
python train_encoder.py --data ../data/ATS-data
Train the Calmness Analysis Model (CAM):
python train_cam.py --data ../data/ATS-data

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
SMSAT Encoder classification accuracy: 99.99%
CAM calmness analysis accuracy: 99.99%
Statistical analyses confirm that Spiritual Meditation â‰ˆ Silence < Music in calmness effect.
Full ablation study, ANOVA, and visualizations are available in results/.
